			<h4 id="psalms-1">Psalms 1</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Blessed is the man / Who does not walk / In the counsel of the wicked, / Nor stand on the path of sinners, / Nor sit in the seat of mockers;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Rather his delight is in the law of Jehovah, / And in His law he meditates by day and by night.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And he will be like a tree / Transplanted beside streams of water, / Which yields its fruit in its season, / And whose foliage does not wither; / And everything he does prospers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> The wicked are not so, / But are like chaff, / Which the wind drives away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment; / Nor the sinners, in the assembly of the righteous.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> For Jehovah knows the way of the righteous, / But the way of the wicked will perish.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Why are the nations in an uproar, / And why do the peoples contemplate a vain thing?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> The kings of the earth take their stand, / And the rulers sit in counsel together, / Against Jehovah and against His Anointed:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Let us break apart Their bonds / And cast Their ropes away from us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> He who sits in the heavens laughs; / The Lord has them in derision.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Then He will speak to them in His anger, / And in His burning wrath He will terrify them:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But I have installed My King / Upon Zion, My holy mountain.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> I will recount the decree of Jehovah; / He said to Me: You are My Son; / Today I have begotten You.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Ask of Me, / And I will give the nations as Your inheritance / And the limits of the earth as Your possession.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> You will break them with an iron rod; / You will shatter them like a potter’s vessel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Now therefore, O kings, be prudent; / Take the admonition, O judges of the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Serve Jehovah with fear, / And rejoice with trembling.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Kiss the Son / Lest He be angry and you perish from the way; / For His anger may suddenly be kindled. / Blessed are all those who take refuge in Him.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> I love You, O Jehovah, my strength.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Jehovah is my crag and my fortress and my Deliverer; / My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; / My shield and the horn of my salvation, my high retreat.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> I called upon Jehovah, who is worthy of praise, And from my enemies I was saved.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> The cords of death encompassed me; / And the torrents of destruction assailed me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> The cords of Sheol surrounded me; / The snares of death confronted me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> In my distress I called upon Jehovah / And cried out to my God. / He heard my voice from His temple, / And my cry before Him came to His ears.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Then the earth shook and quaked, / And the foundations of the mountains trembled and shook about, / For He was furious.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Smoke went up from His nostrils, / And fire from His mouth devoured; / Coals blazed forth from Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> He bowed the heavens and descended, / And deep darkness was under His feet.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> He rode upon a cherub and did fly; / He darted upon the wings of the wind.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> He made darkness His hiding place, His pavilion around Him: / Dark waterclouds, thick clouds of the skies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Out of the brightness before Him there broke through His clouds / Hail and fiery coals.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then Jehovah thundered in heaven, / And the Most High uttered His voice.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And He sent forth His arrows and scattered my enemies; / And He shot forth lightning bolts and discomfited them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> The channels of the sea were seen, / And the foundations of the habitable land were laid bare / At Your rebuke, O Jehovah, / At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> He reached forth from on high; He took me; / He drew me out of great waters.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> He delivered me from my strong enemy / And from those who hate me, for they were too mighty for me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> They confronted me in the day of my calamity, / But Jehovah became my support.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> He brought me forth to a place broad and free; / He rescued me, for He took delight in me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Jehovah has recompensed me according to my righteousness; / According to the cleanness of my hands He has repaid me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> For I have kept the ways of Jehovah / And have not acted wickedly <i>by turning</i> away from my God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> For all His judgments were before me, / And I did not turn His statutes away from me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> I was perfect toward Him, / And I kept myself from my iniquity.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Therefore Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, / According to the cleanness of my hands in His sight.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> With the faithful You show Yourself faithful, / With a perfect man You show Yourself perfect,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> With the pure You show Yourself pure, / And with the perverse You show Yourself contrary.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> For it is You who save the afflicted people, / But the haughty eyes You bring down;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> For it is You who light my lamp; / Jehovah my God lights up my darkness;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> For by You I can run up against a troop; / Indeed by my God I can leap over a wall.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> As for God — His way is perfect; / The word of Jehovah is tried. / He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> For who is God other than Jehovah, / And who is a rock but our God?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> The God who girds me with strength / And makes my way perfect,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Who makes my feet like hinds’ <i>feet</i> / And sets me on my high places,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Who teaches my hands to wage war / So that my arms may bend a bronze bow.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And You have given me the shield of Your salvation, / And Your right hand supports me; / And Your condescending gentleness has made me great.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> You have broadened the places of my steps under me, / And my feet have not slipped.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> I pursued my enemies and overtook them, / And I did not turn back until they were consumed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> I shattered them, so that they were not able to rise up; / They fell under my feet.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And You girded me with strength for war; / You brought down under me those who rose up against me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> You also made my enemies turn <i>their</i> back to me, / And I annihilated those who hated me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> They cried out, but there was no one to save <i>them;</i> / <i>They cried out</i> to Jehovah, but He did not answer them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> Then I beat them like dust before the wind; / Like the mud of the streets I pounded them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> You rescued me from the strivings of the people; / You have made me the head of the nations; / A people whom I had not known serves me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> At the <i>mere</i> hearing of a report, they obey me; / Foreigners come cringing to me;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> Foreigners are discouraged / And come quaking out of their fortresses.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> Jehovah lives; and blessed be my rock, / And exalted be the God of my salvation,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> The God who executes vengeance for me / And subdues peoples under me,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> Who rescues me from my enemies. / Indeed You exalted me above those who rise up against me; / From the violent man You delivered me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>49</b></sup> Therefore I give thanks to You among the nations, O Jehovah; / And I will sing psalms to Your name.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>50</b></sup> <i>It is He</i> who magnifies salvation to His king / And executes lovingkindness to His anointed, / To David and to his seed forever.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> O Jehovah, by Your favor You had made my mountain stand strong. / You hid Your face; I was troubled.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> O God, when You went forth before Your people, / When You marched through the desert, Selah<br><br>

				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Your living <i>flock</i> dwelt in the land; / In Your goodness You provided for the poor, O God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> The Lord gives the command; / The women who bear the glad tidings are a great host.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> The kings of the armies flee. / They flee! / And she who abides at home / Divides the spoil.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Though you lie among the sheepfolds, / There are dove wings covered with silver, / And its pinions, with greenish-yellow gold.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> When the Almighty scattered / The kings in the land, / It snowed on Zalmon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> O mighty mountain, O mountain of Bashan, / O many-peaked mountain, O mountain of Bashan:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Why do you look with envy, O many-peaked mountains, / At the mountain on which God desires to dwell? / Indeed Jehovah will dwell <i>there</i> forever.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> The chariots of God are twenty thousand, / Thousands upon thousands; / The Lord is among them, / <i>As at</i> Sinai, in the sanctuary.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> You have ascended on high; You have led captive those taken captive; / You have received gifts among men, / Even the rebellious ones also, / That Jehovah God may dwell <i>among them.</i><br><br>

				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> God is to us / A God of deliverance, / And with Jehovah the Lord / Are the goings forth <i>even</i> from death.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Indeed God will smash / The head of His enemies, / The hairy crown / Of him who goes about in his guiltiness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> The Lord said, I will bring <i>them</i> again from Bashan; / I will bring <i>them</i> again from the depths of the sea,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> That you may bathe your foot in blood, / That the tongue of your dogs may have their portion from the enemies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> They have seen Your goings, O God, / The goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary:<br><br>

				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> There are little Benjamin, who rules them, / <i>And</i> the princes of Judah <i>in</i> their company, / The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Your God has commanded your strength; / Strengthen, O God, that which You have done for us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Because of Your temple at Jerusalem, / Kings will bring a gift to You.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Rebuke the animals of the reeds, / The herd of the bulls among the calves of the peoples, / Trampling on those who lust after silver; / Scatter the peoples who take delight in war.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Nobles will come out of Egypt; / Cush will quickly stretch out its hands to God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> O kingdoms of the earth, / Sing to God, / Sing psalms to the Lord, Selah<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> To Him who rides upon the ancient heaven of heavens. / Behold, He utters His voice, a mighty voice.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Ascribe strength to God; / His excellence is over Israel, / And His strength is in the skies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> <i>You are</i> awesome, O God, from Your sanctuaries. / The God of Israel, He gives strength and power to the people. / Blessed be God!<br><br>

				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Because for Your sake I have borne reproach; / Humiliation has covered my face.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> I have become a stranger to my brothers, / And a foreigner to my mother’s children.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> The sound of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; / Lightning illuminated the world; / The earth trembled and quaked.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Give ear, O my people, to my instruction; / Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> I will open my mouth in a parable; / I will utter riddles from of old,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Which we have heard and known, / And our fathers have related to us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> We will not hide <i>them</i> from their children, / <i>But</i> will relate to the generation to come / The praises of Jehovah and His strength / And His wondrous deeds that He has done.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Indeed He has established a testimony in Jacob / And appointed a law in Israel, / Which He commanded our fathers / That they should make them known to their children;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> That the generation to come, / The children to be born, may know <i>them,</i> / <i>Who</i> should arise and relate <i>them</i> to their children;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> That they might set their hope in God, / And not forget the deeds of God, / But observe His commandments;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> That they might not be like their fathers, / A stubborn and rebellious generation, / A generation that did not set their heart right, / And whose spirit was not faithful to God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> The children of Ephraim, armed archers with bows, / Turned back in the day of battle.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> They did not keep the covenant of God, / And they refused to walk in His law.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And they forgot His doings / And His wondrous deeds that He had shown them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> He did something wonderful in the sight of their fathers / In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> He divided the sea and caused them to pass through, / And He made the water stand as a heap.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And He led them with the cloud by day / And all the night with a light of fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> He split rocks in the wilderness / And gave <i>them</i> abundant drink, as from the depths.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> He also brought forth streams from the rock / And made water run down like rivers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Yet they still continued to sin against Him, / To rebel against the Most High in the desert.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And they put God to the test in their heart, / By asking for food according to their desire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> They also spoke against God; / They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Behold, He struck the rock, / And water gushed out, / And streams overflowed; / Can He also give <i>us</i> bread, / Or provide meat for His people?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Therefore Jehovah heard and was angry. / And a fire was kindled against Jacob, / And also anger went up against Israel;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Because they did not believe in God, / And they did not trust in His salvation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Yet He commanded the skies above / And opened the doors of heaven;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And He rained down upon them manna to eat / And gave them the food of heaven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Man ate the bread of the mighty; / He sent them full provision.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> He made the east wind blow in the heavens / And guided the south wind by His strength.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And He rained upon them meat like dust, / And winged birds like the sand of the seas.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And He made <i>it</i> fall in the midst of their camp, / Around their habitations.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> So they ate and were well filled; / Indeed what they desired He brought to them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> They were not estranged from what they desired; / Their food was still in their mouths<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> When the anger of God went up against them / And slew <i>some</i> of their fattest ones / And struck down the choice men of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> In spite of all this they still sinned / And did not believe in His wondrous deeds.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Therefore He consumed their days with vanity, / And their years with terror.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> When He slew them, they inquired after Him, / And they returned and diligently sought God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And they remembered that God was their rock, / And the Most High God, their Redeemer.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> But they flattered Him with their mouth / And lied to Him with their tongue.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> For their heart was not steadfast toward Him, / Nor were they faithful to His covenant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> But He, being merciful, forgave <i>their</i> iniquity / And did not destroy <i>them;</i> / Indeed He turned back His anger many times / And did not stir up all His wrath.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And He remembered that they were flesh, / A wind that goes away and does not return.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness / And grieved Him in the desert!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> And they repeatedly put God to the test / And provoked the Holy One of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> They did not remember His hand, / The day when He ransomed them from the adversary;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> When He set His signs in Egypt / And His wonders in the field of Zoan;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> And He turned their rivers into blood, / As well as their streams, so that they could not drink.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> He sent among them a swarm <i>of</i> <i>flies,</i> which devoured them; / And frogs, which destroyed them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> And He gave their increase to the consuming locust, / And their labor to the swarming locust.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> He killed their vines with hail, / And their sycamores with ice stones.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> He gave over their cattle also to the hail / And their herds to the lightning bolts.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>49</b></sup> He sent among them the burning fierceness of His anger, / Overflowing wrath and indignation and trouble, / A mission of angels of evils.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>50</b></sup> He leveled a path for His anger; / He did not spare their soul from death, / But gave their life over to the pestilence.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>51</b></sup> And He struck all the firstborn in Egypt, / The firstfruits of their vigor in the tents of Ham.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>52</b></sup> But He set forth His people like sheep / And led them like a flock in the wilderness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>53</b></sup> And He led them to safety, so that they did not fear; / But the sea covered their enemies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>54</b></sup> And He brought them forth to His holy border, / The mountain, which His right hand had acquired.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>55</b></sup> And He drove out the nations before them / And allotted them as an inheritance by line, / And He made the tribes of Israel dwell <i>there</i> in their tents.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>56</b></sup> Yet they put <i>Him</i> to the test and rebelled against God the Most High, / And did not keep His testimonies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>57</b></sup> And they turned back and dealt treacherously, as their fathers <i>had done;</i> / They turned aside like a deceitful bow.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>58</b></sup> Indeed they provoked Him to anger with their high places / And made Him jealous with their graven images.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>59</b></sup> God heard, and He was angered; / And He greatly abhorred Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>60</b></sup> Thus He forsook the tabernacle in Shiloh, / The tent <i>in which</i> He dwelt among men;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>61</b></sup> And He gave over His Ark into captivity, / And His glory into the hand of the adversary.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>62</b></sup> He also delivered His people to the sword / And was angry with His inheritance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>63</b></sup> Fire devoured their young men, / And their virgins had no marriage song.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>64</b></sup> Their priests fell by the sword, / And their widows did not lament.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>65</b></sup> Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, / Like a mighty man who shouts because of wine.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>66</b></sup> And He struck His adversaries <i>and sent them</i> back; / He put an everlasting reproach upon them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>67</b></sup> And He rejected the tent of Joseph, / And the tribe of Ephraim He did not choose.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>68</b></sup> Rather He chose the tribe of Judah, / Mount Zion, which He loved.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>69</b></sup> And He built His sanctuary like the heights, / Like the earth that He has founded forever.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>70</b></sup> Moreover He chose David His servant / And took him from the sheepfolds;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>71</b></sup> From following after the ewes He brought him / To shepherd Jacob His people / And Israel His inheritance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>72</b></sup> And he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, / And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Do not hide Your face from me / On the day of my distress; / Incline Your ear to me; / On the day when I call out, answer me quickly.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> My heart is stricken like grass and dried up; / Indeed I have <i>even</i> forgotten to eat my bread.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Because of the voice of my groaning / My bones cling to my flesh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> I am like a pelican of the wilderness; / I have become like an owl of the desolate places.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> All day long my enemies reproach me; / Those who deride me use me as a curse.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> For I have eaten ashes like bread, / And have mixed my drink with weeping,<br><br>

				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> My days are like a shadow that declines, / And I am dried up like grass.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> But You, O Jehovah, abide forever; / And Your memorial is from generation to generation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> You will arise <i>and</i> have compassion on Zion, / For it is time to be gracious to her; the appointed time has come.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> For Your servants take pleasure in her stones, / And show favor to her dust.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the nations will fear the name of Jehovah, / And all the kings of the earth, Your glory;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> For Jehovah has built up Zion; / He has appeared in His glory.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> This will be written for a generation to come, / And a people to be created will praise Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> For He has looked down from the height of His sanctuary; / From heaven Jehovah beheld the earth,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> To hear the groaning of the prisoner, / To release those appointed to die;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> That the name of Jehovah may be declared in Zion, / And His praise, in Jerusalem,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> When the peoples are gathered together, / And the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> He has weakened my strength in the way; / He has shortened my days.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> I said, My God, / Do not take me away in the middle of my days; / Your years are throughout all generations.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, / And tempted God in the desert.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And He gave them their request, / But He sent leanness into their soul.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> The earth opened, and it swallowed up Dathan / And covered the company of Abiram.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Wondrous deeds in the land of Ham, / Awesome things by the Red Sea.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Therefore He said that He would destroy them, / <i>And would have,</i> had not Moses His chosen one / Stood in the breach before Him / To turn away His wrath from destroying <i>them.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Then they despised the pleasant land; / They did not believe in His word;<br><br>

				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> They also sacrificed their sons / And their daughters to demons,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> And poured out innocent blood, / The blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; / And the land was polluted with bloodshed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> Thus they were defiled by their practices, / And went about as harlots by their actions.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> For the mouth of the wicked man and the mouth of deceit are opened against me; / They speak to me with a lying tongue.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And with words of hatred they have surrounded me / And have fought against me without cause.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> In return for my love they have become my adversaries, / But I am <i>all</i> prayer.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> May there be no one to extend him mercy, / Nor anyone to be kind to his orphans.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> May they be before Jehovah continually, / So that He may cut off the memory of them from the earth;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Because he did not remember to show lovingkindness, / But persecuted the poor and needy and brokenhearted, / To put <i>them</i> to death.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Indeed he loved cursing, so it came on him; / And he took no delight in blessing, so it was far from him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And he clothed himself with cursing like his garment, / So it came into his inward parts like water / And into his bones like oil.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Let it be to him like the cloak that he wraps around himself, / And as a belt with which he constantly girds himself.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> This is the reward from Jehovah for my adversaries / And for those who speak evil against my soul.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> But You, O Jehovah Lord, deal with me, / For Your name’s sake; / Because Your lovingkindness is good, deliver me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> For I am poor and needy, / And my heart is wounded within me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> I am gone like a shadow that declines; / I am shaken off like the locust.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> My knees wobble through fasting, / And my flesh has become lean, without fatness.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Help me, O Jehovah my God; / Save me according to Your lovingkindness;<br><br>

				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> May my adversaries be clothed with humiliation, / And may they wrap themselves with their own shame as with a mantle.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> I will give much thanks to Jehovah with my mouth, / And in the midst of the multitude I will praise Him;<br><br>

				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Let the high praises of God be in their throats, / And a two-edged sword in their hand,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> To execute vengeance on the nations / <i>And</i> punishment among the peoples;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> To bind their kings with fetters / And their nobles with chains of iron;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> To execute upon them the judgment written. / This honor is for all His faithful ones. / Hallelujah!<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Hallelujah! / Praise God in His sanctuary; / Praise Him in the expanse that <i>manifests</i> His power.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Praise Him for His mighty acts; / Praise Him according to His vast greatness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Praise Him with the blast of the trumpet; / Praise Him with the harp and lyre;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Praise Him with the tambourine and with dancing; / Praise Him with the stringed instrument and the pipe.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Praise Him with the loud cymbals; / Praise Him with the loud clanging cymbals.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Let everything that has breath praise Jehovah. / Hallelujah!<br><br>
