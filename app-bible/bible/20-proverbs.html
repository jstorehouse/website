			<h4 id="proverbs-1">Proverbs 1</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, the king of Israel:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> For knowing wisdom and instruction; / For discerning words of understanding;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> For receiving instruction in wise conduct, / Righteousness, justice, and equity;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> For giving prudence to the simple, / Knowledge and discretion to the young man;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> That the wise man may hear and increase in learning, / And he who has understanding may acquire sound counsel;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> For understanding proverb and figure, / The words of the wise and their difficult sayings.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; / Fools despise wisdom and instruction.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Hear, my son, the instruction of your father, / And do not reject the teaching of your mother;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> For they will be a wreath of grace for your head / And ornaments for your neck.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> My son, if sinners entice you, / Do not consent.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> If they say, Come with us; let us lie in wait for blood; / Let us ambush the innocent without cause;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Let us swallow them alive like Sheol, / And whole, like those who go down into the pit.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> We will find all <i>manner</i> of precious goods; / We will fill our houses with booty;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Throw in your lot with us; / We will all have one purse —<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> My son, do not walk with them on <i>this</i> way; / Keep your foot from their path.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> For their feet run toward evil, / And they hasten to shed blood.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> For in vain is the net spread / In the eyes of any bird;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Yet they lie in wait for their own blood; / They ambush their own lives!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Such are the ways of everyone greedy for gain; / It takes away the life of its owners.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Wisdom cries out in the street; / She utters her voice in the open squares.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> At the head of the tumultuous <i>street</i> she cries; / At the entrance of the gates in the city she utters her sayings:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> How long, O simple ones, will you love simpleness, / And will scoffers delight themselves in scoffing, / And will fools hate knowledge?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Turn yourselves at my reproof — / Immediately I will pour out my spirit on you; / I will make my words known to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Because I called and you refused; / I stretched out my hand and no one heeded,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And you neglected all my counsel / And would have none of my reproof;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> I also will laugh at your calamity; / I will mock when what you dread comes,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> When what you dread comes like a storm, / And your calamity comes like a whirlwind, / When distress and anguish come upon you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; / They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Because they hated knowledge / And did not choose the fear of Jehovah,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> <i>And</i> would have none of my counsel / <i>And</i> despised all my reproof;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> They shall eat of the fruit of their own way / And be filled with their own devices.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> For the turning away of the simple will kill them, / And the prosperity of the foolish will cause them to perish;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> But he who listens to me will dwell securely / And will live at ease, without the dread of evil.<br><br>

			<h4 id="proverbs-2">Proverbs 2</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> My son, if you receive my words / And treasure up my commandments within you,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Making your ear attentive to wisdom / And inclining your heart to understanding;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Indeed, if you cry out for discernment / And lift up your voice for understanding;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> If you seek her like silver / And search for her like hidden treasures,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Then you will understand the fear of Jehovah / And find the knowledge of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> For Jehovah gives wisdom; / From His mouth <i>come</i> knowledge and understanding;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; / <i>He is</i> a shield to those who walk in integrity,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Guarding the paths of justice / And keeping the way of His faithful ones.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then you will understand righteousness and justice / And equity, <i>indeed,</i> every good path.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> For wisdom will enter your heart, / And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Discretion will watch over you; / Understanding will keep you:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> To deliver you from the way of evil, / From the man who speaks perverse things,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> <i>From those</i> who forsake the paths of uprightness / To walk in the ways of darkness,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Who rejoice in doing evil / <i>And</i> delight in the perverseness of evil,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Whose paths are crooked, / And who are devious in their ways;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> To deliver you from the strange woman, / From the adulteress who flatters with her words,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Who forsakes the companion of her youth / And forgets the covenant of her God;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> For her house sinks down to death, / And her paths <i>lead</i> to the dead;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> None who go to her <i>ever</i> return, / Nor do they attain to the paths of life;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> That you may walk in the way of good men / And keep the paths of the righteous;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> For the upright will dwell in the land, / And the perfect will remain in it;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> But the wicked will be cut off from the land, / And the treacherous will be uprooted from it.<br><br>

			<h4 id="proverbs-3">Proverbs 3</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> My son, do not forget my instruction, / But let your heart keep my commandments;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> For length of days and years of life / And peace will they add to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Do not let lovingkindness and truth forsake you: / Bind them around your neck; / Write them upon the tablet of your heart.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Thus you will find favor and <i>a reputation for</i> fine understanding / In the sight of God and man.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, / And do not rely on your own understanding;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> In all your ways acknowledge Him, / And He will make your paths straight.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Do not be wise in your own eyes; / Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> It will be healing to your body / And refreshment to your bones.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Then your barns will be filled with plenty, / And your vats will burst open with new wine.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> My son, do not despise the chastening of Jehovah, / Nor be weary of His discipline;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> For whom Jehovah loves He disciplines, / Even as a father, the son in whom he delights.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, / And the man who gains understanding.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> For her profit is better than the profit of silver, / And her income is better than gold.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> She is more precious than corals, / And nothing you desire compares with her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Length of days is in her right hand; / In her left hand are riches and honor.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, / And all her paths are peace.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her, / And happy are those who hold her fast.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; / He established the heavens by understanding;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> By His knowledge the depths were broken open / And the skies drop down the dew.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> My son, do not let these depart from your sight: / Keep sound wisdom and discretion;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And they will be life for your soul / And a graceful ornament for your neck.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Then you will walk on your way securely, / And your foot will not stumble.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> When you lie down, you will not be afraid; / But you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Do not be afraid of sudden fear, / Nor of the destruction of the wicked when it comes;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> For Jehovah will be your confidence, / And He will keep your foot from being caught.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, / When it is in the power of your hand to do <i>so.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Do not say to your neighbor, Go, and come back; / And tomorrow I will give <i>it</i> — when you have <i>it</i> with you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Do not devise harm against your neighbor, / While he lives securely beside you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Do not strive with a man without cause, / If he has done you no harm.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Do not envy a man of violence, / And do not choose any of his ways;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> For the perverse man is an abomination to Jehovah, / But His intimate counsel is with the upright.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked man, / But He blesses the dwelling place of the righteous.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> To scorners He is scornful, / But to the humble He gives grace.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> The wise will inherit honor, / But fools increase <i>their own</i> disgrace.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And he taught me and said to me, / Let your heart hold fast to my words; / Keep my commandments and live;<br><br>

				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; / Love her, and she will guard you.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> For why should you be ravished, my son, with a strange woman / And embrace the bosom of an adulteress?<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> My son, if you have become a surety for your neighbor, / If you have given your hands as a pledge for a stranger,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> You are snared by the words of your mouth; / You are caught by the words of your mouth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, / Since you have come into the hand of your neighbor: / Go, humble yourself, and plead with your neighbor.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Do not give sleep to your eyes, / Nor slumber to your eyelids.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the <i>hunter’s</i> hand / And like a bird from the fowler’s hand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Go to the ant, you sluggard; / Consider its ways, and be wise,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Which, having no chief, / Officer, or ruler,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Prepares its food in summer / <i>And</i> gathers its sustenance in the harvest.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> How long, sluggard, will you lie <i>there?</i> / When will you arise from your sleep?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> A little sleep, a little slumber, / A little folding of the hands to rest,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And your poverty will come <i>upon you</i> like a robber, / And your want, like an armed man.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> A worthless man, a wicked man, / Goes around with a perverse mouth,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Winking with his eyes, signaling with his feet, / Pointing with his fingers;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> With perverseness in his heart, he is devising evil continually; / He injects discord.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Therefore his calamity will come suddenly; / In a moment he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> There are six things that Jehovah hates; / Indeed, seven that are an abomination to His soul:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, / And hands that shed innocent blood,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> A heart that devises wicked schemes, / Feet that hurry to run to evil,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> A false witness who utters lies, / And one who injects discord among brothers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> My son, keep the commandment of your father, / And do not reject the teaching of your mother;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Bind them continually on your heart; / Tie them around your neck.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> When you walk about, it will guide you, / When you lie down, it will watch over you; / And when you awake, it will talk with you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching a light, / And the reproofs of instruction are the way of life,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> To keep you from the evil woman, / From the smooth tongue of the adulteress.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Do not desire her beauty in your heart, / Nor let her catch you with her eyelids;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> For the price of a harlot is <i>a loaf of</i> bread, / But the wife of <i>another</i> man hunts for the precious soul.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Can a man take fire in his bosom / And his clothes not be burned?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Can a man walk on hot coals / And his feet not be scorched?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> So <i>it is with</i> him who goes in to his neighbor’s wife; / No one who touches her will be unpunished.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> The thief is not despised if he steals / To satisfy himself when he is hungry;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> But if he is found out, he shall restore sevenfold; / He must give over all the substance of his house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> He who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense; / He who does it destroys his own soul.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> He will find wounds and dishonor, / And his reproach will not be wiped away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> For jealousy is the rage of a man, / And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> He will not regard any ransom, / Nor will he be content if you give <i>him</i> great gifts.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> He goes after her immediately, / As an ox goes to the slaughter, / Or as <i>someone in</i> fetters, to the correction of the fool,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Until an arrow pierces through his liver. / As a bird hastens to the snare, / So he does not know that this <i>will cost him</i> his life.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways; / Do not stray into her paths.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> For many are those whom she has brought down wounded, / And numerous are all who have been slain by her.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of His way, / Before His works of old.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> I was set up from eternity, / From the beginning, before the earth was.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> When there were no depths, I was brought forth, / When there were no fountains abounding with water.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Before the mountains were settled, / Before the hills, I was brought forth;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> When He had not yet made the earth and the fields, / Nor the first dust of the world.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> When He established the heavens, I was there; / When He inscribed a circle upon the surface of the deep,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> When He made firm the skies above, / When the fountains of the deep became strong,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> When He set for the sea its boundary, / That the waters should not transgress His commandment, / When He marked out the foundations of the earth;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Then I was by Him, <i>as a</i> master workman; / And I was daily <i>His</i> delight, / Rejoicing always before Him,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Rejoicing in His habitable earth; / And my delight was in the sons of men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> Now therefore, <i>my</i> sons, listen to me; / For blessed are they who keep my ways.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Hear instruction, and be wise; / And do not neglect it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Blessed is the man who listens to me, / Watching daily at my doors, / Waiting at my doorposts.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> For whoever finds me finds life, / And will obtain favor from Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul; / All who hate me love death.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And put a knife to your throat / If you are a man of <i>great</i> appetite.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Do not desire his delicacies, / For they are deceitful food.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Do not weary yourself to become rich; / Cease from your consideration <i>of it.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> When you set your eyes upon it, it is gone; / For <i>wealth</i> certainly makes itself wings, / Like an eagle that flies toward heaven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Do not eat the bread of one who is envious, / And do not desire his delicacies;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> For as he thinks within himself, so he is. / He says to you, Eat and drink; / But his heart is not with you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> You will vomit up the morsel which you have eaten, / And waste your pleasant words.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, / For he will despise the wisdom of your words.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Do not remove the ancient boundary marker, / Or go into the fields of the fatherless;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> For their Redeemer is strong; / He will plead their cause against you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Apply your heart to instruction, / And your ears to words of knowledge.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Do not withhold correction from a child; / If you beat him with the rod, he will not die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> <i>If</i> you beat him with the rod, / You will deliver his soul from Sheol.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> My son, if your heart is wise, / My own heart will also rejoice;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> My inward parts will also exult, / When your lips speak right things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Do not let your heart envy sinners, / But <i>live</i> in the fear of Jehovah all day long;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> For surely there is a latter end, / And your hope will not be cut off.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Listen, my son, and be wise, / And direct your heart in the way.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Do not be among those who get drunk with wine, / Among gluttonous eaters of flesh;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, / And drowsiness will clothe <i>them</i> with rags.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Listen to your father who begot you, / And do not despise your mother when she is old.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Buy truth, and do not sell <i>it;</i> / <i>Buy</i> wisdom and instruction and understanding.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> The father of the righteous man will greatly exult, / And he who begets a wise <i>child</i> will rejoice in him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Let your father and your mother rejoice, / And let her who bore you exult.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> My son, give me your heart, / And let your eyes observe my ways.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> For a harlot is a deep pit, / And an adulteress is a narrow well.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Indeed, she lies in wait as a robber, / And increases <i>the number of</i> the treacherous among men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? / Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Those who linger late over wine, / Those who go to seek out mixed wines.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Do not look upon the wine when it is red, / When it sparkles in the cup, / When it goes down smoothly;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> In the end it bites like a serpent, / And stings like an adder.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Your eyes will see strange things, / And your heart will utter perverse things;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And you will be like one who lies down while at sea, / Or like one who lies down at the top of a mast.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> They struck me, <i>you will say, but</i> I was not hurt; / They beat me, <i>but</i> I did not feel <i>it;</i> / When will I awake? I will seek another drink.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Do not be envious of evil men, / Nor desire to be with them;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> For their heart meditates violence, / And their lips talk of mischief.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Through wisdom a house is built, / And by understanding it is established,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And by knowledge the rooms are filled / With all precious and pleasant riches.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> A wise man is strong, / And a man of knowledge increases power.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> For by sound counsel you can wage your war, / And in the multitude of counselors there is victory.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Wisdom is too high for a fool; / He does not open his mouth in the gate.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> He who devises to do evil, / Men will call him a mischief-maker.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> The devising of folly is sin, / And the scorner is an abomination to men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> If you faint in the day of adversity, / Your strength is limited.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Deliver those who are being taken away to death, / And those who are staggering to be slain, oh, hold back!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> If you say, Look, we did not know this — / Does not He who weighs the hearts consider <i>it?</i> / And He who keeps your soul, does He not know <i>it?</i> / And will He not render to every man according to his work?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> My son, eat honey, for it is good, / And the drippings from the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Know <i>that</i> wisdom is such for your soul; / If you find <i>it,</i> then there will be a latter end, / And your hope will not be cut off.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous man; / Do not destroy his resting place;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> For a righteous man falls seven times and rises up again, / But the wicked are overthrown by calamity.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, / And do not let your heart exult when he is overthrown;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Lest Jehovah see <i>it,</i> and it displease Him, / And He turn away His anger from him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Do not be incensed because of evildoers; / Do not be envious of the wicked;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> For there will be no future for the evil man; / The lamp of the wicked will be put out.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> My son, fear Jehovah and the king, / <i>And</i> do not associate with those who are given to change;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> For their calamity will rise suddenly, / And who knows the misfortune of both of them?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> These also are <i>sayings</i> of the wise: / It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> He who says to the wicked man, You are righteous, / Peoples will curse him; nations will abhor him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> But those who rebuke <i>the wicked man</i> will have delight, / And a good blessing will come upon them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> He who gives an honest answer / Kisses the lips.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Prepare your work outside, / And make it ready for yourself in the field, / And afterward build your house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, / And do not deceive with your lips.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Do not say, I will do to him as he has done to me; / I will render to the man according to his work.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> I passed by the field of the sluggard, / And by the vineyard of the man lacking sense;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And there it was, all overgrown with thorns; / Its surface was covered with nettles, / And its stone wall was broken down.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> When I looked, I considered <i>it;</i> / I saw <i>it</i> and received instruction:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> A little sleep, a little slumber, / A little folding of the hands to rest,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And your poverty will come <i>upon you</i> like a robber, / And your want, like an armed man.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah the king of Judah copied.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, / But the glory of kings is to search a matter out.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> <i>As</i> the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, / So the heart of kings is unsearchable.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Take away the dross from the silver, / And a vessel comes out for the smith;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Take away the wicked man <i>from</i> before the king, / And his throne will be established in righteousness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Do not claim honor for yourself in the presence of the king, / And do not stand in the place of great men;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> For it is better that it is said to you, Come up here, / Than that you should be put lower in the presence of the noble, / Whom your eyes have seen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Do not go out hastily to strive; / Otherwise what will you do in the end, / When your neighbor puts you to shame?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Argue your case with your neighbor <i>himself,</i> / And do not reveal the secret of another;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Lest he who hears it revile you, / And the evil report of you does not go away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> A word fitly spoken / Is <i>like</i> apples of gold in settings of silver.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> <i>Like</i> an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold / Is a wise reprover to a listening ear.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> <i>Like</i> the cold of snow in the time of harvest / Is a faithful messenger to those who send him, / For he refreshes the soul of his masters.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> <i>Like</i> clouds and wind without rain / Is one who boasts of <i>his</i> gifts falsely.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> By forbearance a ruler may be persuaded, / And a soft tongue can break the bone.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Have you found honey? Eat <i>only</i> what you need, / Lest you become filled up with it and vomit it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house, / Otherwise he will become weary of you and hate you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> A man who bears false witness against his neighbor / Is <i>like</i> a club and a sword and a sharp arrow.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Confidence in a treacherous man in time of trouble / Is <i>like</i> a bad tooth and a foot out of joint.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> He who sings songs to a troubled heart / Is <i>like</i> one who takes off a garment on a cold day, / Or <i>like</i> vinegar on soda.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat; / And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> For you will heap coals of fire upon his head, / And Jehovah will reward you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> The north wind brings forth rain; / And a backbiting tongue, an angry countenance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop / Than in a house shared with a contentious woman.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> <i>Like</i> cold water to a thirsty soul, / So is good news from a far country.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> <i>Like</i> a muddied fountain and a polluted spring / Is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked man.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> It is not good to eat much honey, / Nor is it glory <i>for men</i> to search out their own glory.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> <i>As</i> charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, / So is a contentious man to kindle strife.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Who has ascended into heaven and descended? / Who has gathered the wind in His fists? / Who has wrapped up the waters in His garment? / Who has established all the ends of the earth? / What is His name, and what is His Son’s name, if you know?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Every word of God is tried; / He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Do not add to His words, / Lest He reprove you and you be found a liar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Two things I have asked of You; / Do not refuse me before I die:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Remove far from me falsehood and lies. / Give me neither poverty nor riches; / Feed me with the food that is my portion,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Lest I become full and deny <i>You</i> and say, Who is Jehovah? / Or lest I become poor and steal and profane the name of my God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Do not slander a servant to his master, / Lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> There is a generation that curse their father, / And do not bless their mother.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, / And <i>yet</i> are not washed from their filthiness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> There is a generation — oh how lofty are their eyes, / And their eyelids are raised <i>arrogantly.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> There is a generation whose teeth are <i>like</i> swords, / And their jaw teeth <i>like</i> knives, / To devour the afflicted from off the earth, / And the needy from among men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> The leech has two daughters, <i>crying,</i> Give, give. / There are three things that are never satisfied, / <i>Indeed,</i> four that do not say, Enough:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Sheol and the barren womb, / The earth that is not satisfied with water, / And the fire that does not say, Enough.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> The eye that mocks his father / And despises to obey his mother, / The ravens of the valley will pick it out, / And the young eagles will eat it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> There are three things which are too wonderful for me, / Indeed four which I do not know:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> The way of an eagle in the sky, / The way of a serpent upon a rock, / The way of a ship in the midst of the sea, / And the way of a man with a maiden.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> This is the way of an adulterous woman: / She eats and wipes her mouth / And says, I have done no wickedness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Under three things the earth quakes, / And under four, it cannot bear up:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Under a servant when he is king, / And a fool when he is filled with food;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Under a hated woman when she gets married, / And a servant girl who is heir to her mistress.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Four things are small on the earth, / But they are exceedingly wise:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> The ants are a clan without strength, / Yet they prepare their food in the summer;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> The rock badgers are a clan without might, / Yet they make their houses in the rocks;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> The swarming locusts have no king, / Yet all of them go out in ranks;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> The lizard can be grasped with the hands, / Yet she is in kings’ palaces.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> There are three things which are stately in <i>their</i> step, / Indeed four which are stately in walking:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> The lion, which is mightiest among beasts, / And does not turn back before any;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> The strutting cock girded in the loins, or a male goat, / And a king <i>who has</i> a band of soldiers with him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> If you have been foolish in exalting yourself, / Or if you have thought an evil scheme, / <i>Put your</i> hand upon your mouth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> For the churning of milk produces butter, / And the wringing of the nose brings forth blood, / So the pressing of wrath brings forth strife.<br><br>

			<h4 id="proverbs-31">Proverbs 31</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> The words of King Lemuel. The oracle which his mother taught him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> What, my son? and what, O son of my womb? / And what, O son of my vows?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Do not give your strength to women, / Nor your ways to that which destroys kings.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; / Nor for princes <i>to say,</i> Where is strong drink?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Lest they drink and forget what is decreed, / And pervert the rights of all the afflicted.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Give strong drink <i>rather</i> to one who is perishing, / And wine to the bitter in soul;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Let him drink and forget his poverty, / And remember his misery no more.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Open your mouth for the dumb, / <i>And</i> for the rights of all those who are passing away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Open your mouth; judge righteously, / And minister justice to the poor and needy.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Who can find a worthy woman? / For her price is far above corals.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> The heart of her husband trusts in her, / And he will have no lack of gain.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> She does him good and not evil / All the days of her life.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> She seeks wool and flax, / And delights to work with her hands.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> She is like the merchant ships; / She brings her food from afar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> She rises also while it is still night / And gives food to her household, / And <i>their</i> task to her <i>serving</i> girls.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> She considers a field and buys it; / With the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> She girds her loins with strength / And makes strong her arms.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> She samples her merchandise <i>to be sure</i> it is good; / Her lamp does not go out by night.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> She lays her hands to the distaff, / And her hands hold on to the spindle.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> She stretches out her hand to the afflicted, / And she reaches out her hands to the needy.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> She does not fear for her household when it snows, / For all her household are clothed with scarlet.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> She makes coverings for herself; / Her clothing is fine linen and purple.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Her husband is known in the gates, / When he sits among the elders of the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> She makes linen garments and sells them / And delivers girdles to the merchant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Strength and dignity are her clothing, / And she happily looks forward to the time to come.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> She opens her mouth with wisdom, / And the law of kindness is on her tongue.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> She watches closely over the ways of her household / And does not eat the bread of idleness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Her children rise up and call her blessed; / Her husband <i>also,</i> and he praises her, <i>saying:</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Many daughters have done worthily, / But you surpass them all.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain; / <i>But</i> a woman who fears Jehovah, she will be praised.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Give her of the fruit of her hands, / And let her works praise her in the gates.<br><br>
