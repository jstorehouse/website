			<h4 id="philemon-1">Philemon 1</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow worker<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And to Apphia the sister and to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church, which is in your house:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Hearing of your love and the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and to all the saints,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> That the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the full knowledge of every good thing which is in you for Christ.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> For I had much joy and encouragement over your love, because the inward parts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Therefore though I have much boldness in Christ to charge you what is fitting,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Because of love I rather entreat, being such a one as Paul the aged and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> I entreat you concerning my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Who formerly was useless to you but now is useful both to you and to me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Him I have sent back to you — him, that is, my very heart —<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Whom I intended to keep with myself that on your behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the gospel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> But without your mind I did not want to do anything, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but voluntary.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> For perhaps for this reason he was separated from you for but an hour, that you might fully have him forever,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> No longer as a slave, but above a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> If then you hold me as a partner, receive him as myself.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And if he has wronged you in anything or owes anything, charge that to my account.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> I, Paul, have written with my own hand: I will repay; not to say to you that you owe me even your own self besides.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Yes, brother, may I have profit from you in the Lord; refresh my inward parts in Christ.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Having confidence in your obedience, I have written to you, knowing that you will do even beyond the things that I say.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And at the same time also prepare me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> As do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. <br><br>
