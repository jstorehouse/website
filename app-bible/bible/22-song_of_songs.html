			<h4 id="songofsongs-1">Song of Songs 1</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! / For your love is better than wine.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance; / Your name is like ointment poured forth; / Therefore the virgins love you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Draw me; we will run after you — The king has brought me into his chambers — / We will be glad and rejoice in you; / We will extol your love more than wine. / Rightly do they love you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> I am black but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, / Like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Do not look at me, because I am black, / Because the sun has scorched me. / My mother’s sons were angry with me; / They made me keeper of the vineyards, / <i>But</i> my own vineyard I have not kept.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture <i>your flock?</i> / Where do you make <i>it</i> lie down at noon? / For why should I be like one who is veiled / Beside the flocks of your companions?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> If you yourself do not know, / You fairest among women, / Go forth on the footsteps of the flock, / And pasture your young goats / By the shepherds’ tents.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> I compare you, my love, / To a mare among Pharaoh’s chariots.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Your cheeks are lovely with plaits of ornaments, / Your neck with strings of jewels.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> We will make you plaits of gold / With studs of silver.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> While the king was at his table, / My spikenard gave forth its fragrance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh / <i>That</i> lies at night between my breasts.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> My beloved is to me a cluster of henna flowers / In the vineyards of En-gedi.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Oh, you are beautiful, my love! / Oh, you are beautiful! Your eyes are <i>like</i> doves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Oh, you are beautiful, my beloved; indeed, pleasant! Indeed, our couch is green.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> The beams of our house are cedars; / Our rafters are cypresses.<br><br>

			<h4 id="songofsongs-2">Song of Songs 2</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> I am a rose of Sharon, / A lily of the valleys.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> As a lily among thorns, / So is my love among the daughters.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, / So is my beloved among the sons: In his shade I delighted and sat down, / And his fruit was sweet to my taste.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> He brought me into the banqueting house, / And his banner over me was love.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Sustain me with raisin cakes, / Refresh me with apples, / For I am sick with love.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> His left hand is under my head, / And his right hand embraces me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / By the gazelles or by the hinds of the fields, / Not to rouse up or awaken <i>my</i> love / Until she pleases.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> The voice of my beloved! Now he comes, / Leaping upon the mountains, / Skipping upon the hills.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart. / Now he stands behind our wall; / He is looking through the windows, / He is glancing through the lattice.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> My beloved responds and says to me, / Rise up, my love, / My beauty, and come <i>away;</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> For now the winter is past; / The rain is over <i>and</i> gone.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Flowers appear on the earth; / The time of singing has come, / And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> The fig tree has ripened its figs, / And the vines are in blossom — they give forth their fragrance. / Rise up, my love, / My beauty, and come <i>away.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> My dove, in the clefts of the rock, / In the covert of the precipice,Let me see your countenance, / Let me hear your voice; / For your voice is sweet, / And your countenance is lovely.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Catch the foxes for us, / The little foxes, / That ruin the vineyards / While our vineyards are in blossom.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> My beloved is mine, and I am his; / He pastures <i>his flock</i> among the lilies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Until the day dawns and the shadows flee away, / Turn, my beloved, <i>and</i> be like a gazelle or a young hart / On the mountains of Bether.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> On my bed night after night / I sought him whom my soul loves; / I sought him, but found him not.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> I will rise now and go about in the city; / In the streets and in the squares / I will seek him whom my soul loves. / I sought him, but found him not.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> The watchmen who go about in the city found me — / Have you seen him whom my soul loves?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Scarcely had I passed them / When I found him whom my soul loves; / I held him and would not let go / Until I had brought him into my mother’s house / And into the chamber of her who conceived me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / By the gazelles or by the hinds of the fields, / Not to rouse up or awaken <i>my</i> love / Until she pleases.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Who is she who comes up from the wilderness / Like pillars of smoke, / Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, / With all the fragrant powders of the merchant?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> There is Solomon’s bed; / Sixty mighty men surround it, / Of the mighty men of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> All of them wield the sword <i>and</i> are expert in war; / Each man has his sword at his thigh / Because of the night alarms.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> King Solomon made himself a palanquin / Of the wood of Lebanon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Its posts he made of silver; / Its bottom, of gold; / Its seat, of purple; / Its midst was inlaid <i>with</i> love / From the daughters of Jerusalem.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Go forth, O daughters of Zion, / And look at King Solomon with the crown / With which his mother crowned him / On the day of his espousals, / Yes, on the day of the gladness of his heart.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Oh, you are beautiful, my love! / Oh, you are beautiful! Your eyes are <i>like</i> doves behind your veil; / Your hair is like a flock of goats / That repose on Mount Gilead.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes / That have come up from the washing, / All of which have borne twins, / And none of them is bereaved of her young.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Your lips are like a scarlet thread, / And your mouth is lovely; / Your cheeks are like a piece of pomegranate / Behind your veil.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Your neck is like the tower of David, / Built for an armory: / A thousand bucklers hang on it, / All the shields of the mighty men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Your two breasts are like two fawns, / Twins of a gazelle, / That feed among the lilies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Until the day dawns and the shadows flee away, / I, for my part, will go to the mountain of myrrh / And to the hill of frankincense.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> You are altogether beautiful, my love, / And there is no blemish in you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> <i>Come</i> with me from Lebanon, <i>my</i> bride; / With me from Lebanon come. / Look from the top of Amana, / From the top of Senir and Hermon, / From the lions’ dens, / From the leopards’ mountains.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> You have ravished my heart, my sister, <i>my</i> bride; / You have ravished my heart with one <i>glance</i> of your eyes, / With one strand of your necklace.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> How beautiful is your love, my sister, <i>my</i> bride! / How much better is your love than wine, / And the fragrance of your ointments / Than all spices!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Your lips drip fresh honey, <i>my</i> bride; / Honey and milk are under your tongue; / And the fragrance of your garments / Is like the fragrance of Lebanon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> A garden enclosed is my sister, <i>my</i> bride, / A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates / With choicest fruit; / Henna with spikenard,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Spikenard and saffron; / Calamus and cinnamon, / With all the trees of frankincense; / Myrrh and aloes, / With all the chief spices.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> A fountain in gardens, / A well of living water, / And streams from Lebanon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Awake, O north wind; / And come, O south wind! / Blow upon my garden: / Let its spices flow forth; / Let my beloved come into his garden / And eat his choicest fruit.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> I sleep, but my heart is awake. / A sound! My beloved is knocking. / Open to me, my sister, my love, / My dove, my perfect one; / For my head is drenched with dew, / My locks with the drops of night.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> I have put off my garment; / How can I put it on <i>again?</i> / I have washed my feet; / How can I dirty them <i>again?</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> My beloved put his hand into the opening <i>of the door,</i> / And my inner parts yearned for him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> I rose up to open to my beloved; / And my hands dripped with myrrh, / My fingers with liquid myrrh, / Upon the handles of the bolt.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> I opened to my beloved, / But my beloved had withdrawn; he was gone. / My soul failed when he spoke; / I sought him, but found him not; / I called him — he answered me not.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> The watchmen who go about the city found me. / They struck me; they wounded me; / The keepers of the walls took my veil from me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / If you find my beloved, / What shall you tell him? / That I am sick with love.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> What is your beloved more than <i>some other’s</i> beloved, / O you most beautiful among women? / What is your beloved more than <i>some other’s</i> beloved, / That you adjure us so?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> My beloved is dazzling white yet ruddy, / Distinguished among ten thousand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> His head is the finest gold; / His locks are wavy, / As black as a raven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> His eyes are like doves / Beside the streams of water, / Bathed in milk, / Fitly set.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> His cheeks are like a bed of spices, / Mounds of sweetly fragrant herbs; / His lips are lilies, / Dripping with liquid myrrh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> His hands are tubes of gold, / Set with beryl; / His belly is an ivory work, / Overlaid with sapphires.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> His legs are pillars of white marble, / Set upon bases of gold; / His appearance is like Lebanon, / As excellent as the cedars.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> His mouth is sweetness itself, / And he is altogether desirable. / This is my beloved, and this is my friend, / O daughters of Jerusalem.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> My beloved has gone down to his garden, / To the beds of spices, / To feed in the gardens / And gather lilies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine; / He pastures <i>his flock</i> among the lilies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> You are as beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, / As lovely as Jerusalem, / As terrible as an army with banners.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Turn your eyes away from me, / For they overwhelm me. / Your hair is like a flock of goats / That repose on Mount Gilead.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> My dove, my perfect one, is but one; / She is the only one of her mother; / She is the choice one of her who bore her. / The daughters saw her, and they called her blessed; / The queens and the concubines, / They also praised her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Who is this woman who looks forth like the dawn, / As beautiful as the moon, / As clear as the sun, / As terrible as an army with banners?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> I went down to the orchard of nuts / To see the freshness of the valley, / To see whether the vine had budded, / Whether the pomegranates were in bloom.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Before I was aware, / My soul set me <i>among</i> the chariots of my noble people.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Return, return, O Shulammite; / Return, return, that we may gaze at you. / Why should you gaze at the Shulammite, / As upon the dance of two camps?<br><br>

				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Your navel is a round goblet / That never lacks mixed wine; / Your belly is a heap of wheat, / Fenced in by lilies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Your two breasts are like two fawns, / Twins of a gazelle.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Your neck is like a tower of ivory; / Your eyes, <i>like</i> the pools in Heshbon / By the gate of Bath-rabbim; / Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, / Which faces Damascus.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields; / Let us lodge in the villages.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Let us rise up early for the vineyards; / Let us see if the vine has budded, / <i>If</i> the blossom is open, / <i>If</i> the pomegranates are in bloom; / There I will give you my love.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Oh that you were like a brother to me, / Who nursed at my mother’s breasts! / If I found you outside, I would kiss you, / And none would despise me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> I would lead you <i>and</i> bring you / Into my mother’s house, / Who has instructed me; / I would make you drink spiced wine / From the juice of my pomegranate.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / Do not rouse up or awaken <i>my</i> love / Until she pleases.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, / Leaning on her beloved? / I awakened you under the apple tree: / There your mother was in labor with you; / There she was in labor <i>and</i> brought you forth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Set me as a seal on your heart, / As a seal on your arm; / For love is as strong as death, / Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol; / Its flashes are the flashes of fire, / A flame of Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Many waters cannot quench love, / Nor do floods drown it. / If a man gave all the substance of his house for love, / It would be utterly despised.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> We have a little sister, / And she has no breasts: / What shall we do for our sister / On the day when she is spoken for?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> If she is a wall, / We will build on her a battlement of silver; / And if she is a door, / We will enclose her with boards of cedar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers; / Then I was in his eyes like one who has found peace.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon: / He let out the vineyard to keepers; / Each was to bring a thousand <i>shekels</i> of silver for its fruit.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> O you who dwell in the gardens, / <i>My</i> companions listen for your voice; / Let me hear <i>it.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Make haste, my beloved, / And be like a gazelle or a young hart / Upon the mountains of spices.<br><br>
