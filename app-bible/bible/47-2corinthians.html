			<h4 id="2corinthians-1">2 Corinthians 1</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy the brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all comfort,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Who comforts us in all our affliction that we may be able to comfort those who are in every affliction through the comforting with which we ourselves are comforted by God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> For even as the sufferings of the Christ abound unto us, so through the Christ our comfort also abounds.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But whether we are afflicted, it is for your comforting and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comforting, which operates in the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And our hope for you is firm, knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you are of the comfort.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Indeed we ourselves had the response of death in ourselves, that we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us; in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver us,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> If you also help in this by petition on our behalf, that for the gift to us through many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> For no other things do we write to you than what you read or even know; and I hope that you will know unto the end,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Even as also you know us in part, that we are your boast, just as you also are ours in the day of our Lord Jesus.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And in this confidence I intended to come to you previously that you might have double grace,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And through you to pass through into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you and be sent forward by you into Judea.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> This therefore intending, did I then use fickleness? Or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that with me there should be Yes, yes and No, no?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yes and no.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us, through me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but our word has become yes in Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> For as many promises of God as there are, in Him is the Yes; therefore also through Him is the Amen to God, for glory through us to God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> But the One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> He who has also sealed us and given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> But I call on God as a witness against my soul that to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are fellow workers with you for your joy; for by faith you stand. <br><br>

			<h4 id="2corinthians-2">2 Corinthians 2</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> For if I cause you sorrow, who then is the one who makes me glad, except the one who is made sorrowful by me?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And I wrote this very thing to you that when I come I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice, having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that you would be made sorrowful but that you would know the love which I have more abundantly toward you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> But if anyone has caused sorrow, he has not caused me to sorrow, but in part (lest I lay too heavy a burden) all of you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Sufficient for such a one is this punishment by the majority,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> So that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with excessive sorrow.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Therefore I exhort you to confirm your love toward him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> For to this end also I wrote, that I might know your approvedness, whether you are obedient in all things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> But whom you forgive anything, I also forgive; for also what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is for your sake in the person of Christ;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> That we may not be taken advantage of by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Furthermore, when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door was open to me in the Lord,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> I had no rest in my spirit, for I did not find Titus my brother; but taking leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ and manifests the savor of the knowledge of Him through us in every place.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> To some a savor out of death unto death, and to the others a savor out of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> For we are not like the many, adulterating the word of God for profit; but as out of sincerity, but as out of God, before God we speak in Christ. <br><br>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="2corinthians-3">2 Corinthians 3</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some do, letters of commendation to you or from you?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> You are our letter, inscribed in our hearts, known and read by all men,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And such confidence we have through Christ toward God,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Moreover if the ministry of death, engraved in stone in letters, came about in glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, a glory which was being done away with,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> How shall the ministry of the Spirit not be more in glory?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> For if there is glory with the ministry of condemnation, much more the ministry of righteousness abounds with glory.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> For also that which has been glorified in this respect has not been glorified on account of the surpassing glory.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> For if that which was being done away with was through glory, much more that which remains is in glory.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Therefore since we have such hope, we use much boldness,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And are not like Moses, who put a veil on his face so that the sons of Israel would not gaze at the end of that which was being done away with.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> But their thoughts were hardened; for until the present day the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant, it not being unveiled to them that the veil is being done away with in Christ.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Indeed unto this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit. <br><br>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="2corinthians-4">2 Corinthians 4</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Therefore having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those who are perishing,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> In whom the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine on them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus’ sake.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> We are pressed on every side but not constricted; unable to find a way out but not utterly without a way out;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Persecuted but not abandoned; cast down but not destroyed;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> So then death operates in us, but life in you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And having the same spirit of faith according to that which is written, “I believed, therefore I spoke,” we also believe, therefore we also speak,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will make us stand before Him with you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> For all things are for your sakes that the grace which has abounded through the greater number may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> For our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Because we do not regard the things which are seen but the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal. <br><br>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="2corinthians-5">2 Corinthians 5</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> For we know that if our earthly tabernacle dwelling is taken down, we have a building from God, a dwelling not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> For also in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our dwelling place from heaven,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> If indeed, being clothed, we will not be found naked.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> For also, we who are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened, in that we do not desire to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Now He who has wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the Spirit as a pledge.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Therefore being always of good courage and knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are abroad from the Lord<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> (For we walk by faith, not by appearance) —<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> We are of good courage then and are well pleased rather to be abroad from the body and at home with the Lord.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Therefore also we are determined, whether at home or abroad, to gain the honor of being well pleasing to Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; yet I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> We are not again commending ourselves to you, but so speak in order to give you an opportunity to boast on our behalf, that you may have an answer for those who are boasting in outward appearance and not in heart.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> For whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God; or whether we are sober-minded, it is for you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> So then we, from now on, know no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> But all things are out from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Namely, that God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting their offenses to them, and has put in us the word of reconciliation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. <br><br>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="2corinthians-6">2 Corinthians 6</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And working together with Him, we also entreat you not to receive the grace of God in vain;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> For He says, “In an acceptable time I listened to you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is the well-acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> We give no occasion of stumbling in anything that the ministry may not be faulted,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> But in everything we commend ourselves as ministers of God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> In pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in a holy spirit, in unfeigned love,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> In the word of truth, in the power of God; through the weapons of righteousness on the right and on the left,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> As unknown and yet well known; as dying and yet behold we live; as being disciplined and yet not being put to death;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> As made sorrowful yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing and yet possessing all things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians; our heart is enlarged.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> You are not constricted in us, but you are constricted in your inward parts.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> But for a recompense in kind, I speak as to children, you also be enlarged.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And what concord does Christ have with Belial? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, even as God said, “I will dwell among them and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Therefore “come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you”;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> “And I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty.” <br><br>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="2corinthians-7">2 Corinthians 7</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Therefore since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Make room for us; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> I do not say this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts for our dying together and our living together.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Great is my boldness toward you, great is my boasting on your behalf; I am filled with comfort, I overflow with joy in all our affliction.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> For even when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted in everything; without were fightings, within were fears.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But He who comforts those who are downcast, that is, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted because of you, declaring to us your longing, your lamentation, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> For though I caused you sorrow by the letter, I do not regret it. Even if I did regret it (for I see that that letter, even if for an hour, caused you sorrow),<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to God, that in nothing you might suffer loss from us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> For sorrow according to God works repentance unto salvation, which is without regret; but the sorrow of the world works out death.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> For behold this very thing, your being made sorrowful according to God, what earnestness it has worked out in you, indeed what defense, indeed what indignation, indeed what fear, indeed what longing, indeed what zeal, indeed what punishment! In everything you have commended yourselves to be pure in the matter.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> So then, though I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of him who did the wrong, nor for the sake of him who was wronged, but for the sake of manifesting to you before God your earnestness for us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Because of this we have been comforted.        And in addition to our comfort, we rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> For if in anything I boasted to him on your behalf, I have not been put to shame; on the contrary, as we spoke all things in truth to you, so also our boasting before Titus turned out to be the truth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And his affections are abundantly toward you, he remembering the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> I rejoice that in everything I have boldness because of you. <br><br>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="2corinthians-8">2 Corinthians 8</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Furthermore we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> That in much proving of affliction the abundance of their joy and the depth of their poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> That according to their power, I testify, and beyond their power, of their own accord,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> With much entreaty they besought of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And this, not as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> So we entreated Titus that, even as he began before, so also he would complete for you this grace as well.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> But just as you abound in everything, in faith and in word and in knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love in you from us, abound in this grace also.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> I am not speaking by way of command, but through the earnestness of others, proving also the genuineness of your love.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, for your sakes He became poor in order that you, because of His poverty, might become rich.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And I give my opinion in this matter, for this is profitable for you who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do this but even to intend to do this.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> But now complete also the doing, so that as there was the eagerness in intending, so also there would be the completing out of what you have.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> For if the eagerness is there, it is acceptable according to whatever one has, not according to what he does not have.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> For it is not that to others there would be relief, yet to you affliction,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> But it is out of equality; at the present time your abundance for their lack that their abundance also may be for your lack, so that there may be equality;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> As it is written, “He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> But thanks be to God who puts the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of Titus,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Because he not only received the entreaty, but being more earnest, he also went forth of his own accord to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And we sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the churches,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And not only this, but who has also been selected by the churches as our fellow traveler in this grace which is being ministered by us, to the glory of the Lord Himself and to demonstrate our eagerness;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Avoiding this, that anyone should find fault with us in this abundance which is being ministered by us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> For we exercise foresight for what is honorable not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And we sent with them our brother, whom we have proved to be diligent in many things many times, yet now much more diligent because of the great confidence he has toward you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Whether concerning Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you; or our brothers, they are apostles of the churches, they are Christ’s glory.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Show therefore to them, in the face of the churches, the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf. <br><br>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="2corinthians-9">2 Corinthians 9</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> For concerning the ministry to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> For I know your eagerness, of which I boast on your behalf to the Macedonians, that Achaia has been prepared since last year; and your zeal has stirred up the greater number of them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> But I sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf might not be made void in this respect, that, as I said, you might be prepared;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Lest, if the Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we, not to mention you, be put to shame in this confidence.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Therefore I thought it necessary to entreat the brothers to go before to you and make ready beforehand your previously promised blessing, that thus this might be ready as a blessing and not as a matter of covetousness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But take note of this: He who sows sparingly shall also sparingly reap; and he who sows with blessings shall also with blessings reap;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Each one as he has purposed in his heart, not out of sorrow or out of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And God is able to make all grace abound unto you, that, in everything always having all sufficiency, you may abound unto every good work;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Even as it is written, “He has scattered abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness abides forever.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Now He who bountifully supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed and cause the fruits of your righteousness to increase.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> You in everything are being enriched unto all liberality, which works out through us thanksgiving to God,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Because the ministry of this service is not only filling up the lack of the saints, but is also abounding through many thanksgivings to God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> They, through the approving of this ministry, are glorifying God based upon the subjection unto the gospel of Christ that issues from your confession, and upon the liberality of the fellowship to them and to all;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> While in petition on your behalf they also long after you on account of the surpassing grace of God upon you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift! <br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> But I myself, Paul, entreat you through the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who (as you say) in person am base among you, but while absent am bold toward you,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> I beseech you that when present I would not have to be bold in the confidence with which I count myself, to dare do to some who count us as ones who are walking according to flesh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> For though we walk in flesh, we do not war according to flesh;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful before God for the overthrowing of strongholds,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> As we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And we are ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> You look at things according to their appearance. If someone has confidence in himself to be of Christ, let him take account of this again concerning himself, that even as he is of Christ, so also are we.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> For even if I should boast somewhat more abundantly concerning our authority, which the Lord has given for building you up and not for overthrowing you, I will not be put to shame.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> I say this so as not to seem as if I am terrifying you through my letters,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Because while his letters, someone says, are weighty and strong, his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Let such a one take account of this, that such as we are in word by letters when absent, such also we are in deed when present.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> For we do not dare to class or compare ourselves with any of those who commend themselves; but they, measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> But we will not boast beyond our measure but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach even as far as you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> For we are not extending ourselves beyond our bounds, as if we did not reach you, for we were the first to come even as far as unto you in the gospel of Christ.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> We are not boasting beyond our measure in others’ labors, but have the hope, as your faith is increasing, to be magnified in you according to our rule unto abundance,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> So that we may announce the gospel unto those parts beyond you, not so that we may boast in another man’s rule in things already prepared.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> But he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends. <br><br>

			<h4 id="2corinthians-11">2 Corinthians 11</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness; but indeed you do bear with me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> But I fear lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your thoughts would be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity toward Christ.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> For if indeed he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or you receive a different spirit, which you have not received, or a different gospel, which you have not accepted, you bear well with him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> But I count myself to be inferior to the super-apostles in nothing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But even if I am a layman in speech, yet I am not in knowledge; indeed in every way we have made this manifest in all things to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Or did I commit a sin, abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I announced the gospel of God to you free of charge?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> I robbed other churches, taking wages for the ministry to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And when I was present with you and lacked, I was not a burden to anyone; for the brothers who came from Macedonia filled up my lack, and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and will keep myself.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> The truthfulness of Christ is in me, that this boasting shall not be stopped as it regards me in the regions of Achaia.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Why? Because I do not love you? God knows.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> But what I do, I also will do, that I may cut off the opportunity of those desiring an opportunity, that in the thing in which they boast, they may be found even as we.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> For such ones are false apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And no wonder, for Satan himself transfigures himself into an angel of light.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Therefore it is no great thing if also his ministers transfigure themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Again I say, Let no one think me to be foolish; but if otherwise, accept me even as if I were foolish, that I also may boast a little.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord but as if in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Since many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> For you bear gladly with fools because you yourselves are wise.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> For you bear it if anyone enslaves you, if anyone devours you, if anyone takes you, if anyone lifts himself up, if anyone beats you in the face.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> By way of self-disparagement I say this, Supposedly we ourselves were weak.        But in whatever anyone else is daring, I speak in foolishness, I also am daring.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Hebrews are they? I also. Israelites are they? I also. The seed of Abraham are they? I also.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Ministers of Christ are they? I speak as being beside myself, I more so! In labors more abundantly, in imprisonments more abundantly, in stripes excessively, in deaths often.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Under the hands of the Jews five times I received forty stripes less one;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> In journeys often, in dangers of rivers, in dangers of robbers, in dangers from my race, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers in the sea, in dangers among false brothers;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> In labor and hardship; in watchings often; in hunger and thirst; in fastings often; in cold and nakedness —<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Apart from the things which have not been mentioned, there is this: the crowd of cares pressing upon me daily, the anxious concern for all the churches.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is stumbled, and I myself do not burn?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> If I must boast, I will boast of the things of my weakness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, He who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> In Damascus, the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And in a basket I was lowered through a window, through the wall, and escaped his hands. <br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> To boast is necessary, though indeed not expedient; yet I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know; God knows) such a one was caught away to the third heaven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And I know such a man (whether in the body or outside the body, I do not know; God knows),<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> That he was caught away into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not allowed for a man to speak.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> For if I desire to boast, I will not be foolish, for I will speak the truth; but I refrain lest anyone account of me something above what he sees me to be or hears from me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And because of the transcendence of the revelations, in order that I might not be exceedingly lifted up, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, that he might buffet me, in order that I might not be exceedingly lifted up.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Concerning this I entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Therefore I am well pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions and distresses, on behalf of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am powerful.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> I have become foolish; you yourselves have compelled me. For it is I who should have been commended by you; for in nothing am I inferior to the super-apostles, even though I am nothing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Indeed the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all endurance by signs and wonders and works of power.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> For what is there in which you were treated in a manner inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself was not a burden to you? Graciously forgive me this injustice!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden; for I do not seek what is yours but you. For the children ought not to store up for the parents, but the parents for the children.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> But I, I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved less?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> But let it be so! I did not burden you; but, as some of you say, being crafty, I took you by guile.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Did I take advantage of you through anyone whom I have sent to you?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> I entreated Titus and sent with him the brother. Titus did not take advantage of you, did he? Did we not walk in the same spirit? In the same steps?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> All this time you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you. Before God in Christ we speak; but all things, beloved, are for your building up.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> For I fear that perhaps when I come, I may find you not such as I wish, and I may be found by you not such as you wish; that perhaps there may be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambitions, slanders, whisperings, demonstrations of being puffed up, tumults;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> That when I come again my God may humble me before you and I may mourn over many who have sinned before and who have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and licentiousness which they have practiced. <br><br>
			</p>

		<div class="bible-text">

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> This third time I am coming to you; at the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> I have previously said and I say beforehand, when I was present the second time and being absent now, to those who have sinned before and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Since you seek a proof of the Christ who is speaking in me, who is not weak unto you but is powerful in you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> For indeed He was crucified out of weakness, but He lives by the power of God. For indeed we are weak in Him, but we will live together with Him by the power of God directed toward you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves. Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But I hope that you will know that we are not disapproved.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Now we pray to God that you do nothing wrong, not that we may appear approved, but that you yourselves may do what is good and we may be as if disapproved.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> For we are not able to do anything against the truth but rather for the truth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> For we rejoice whenever we are weak and you are powerful; this also we pray for, your perfecting.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Therefore I write these things while being absent in order that when present I would not have to use severity, according to the authority which the Lord has given me for building up and not for overthrowing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Finally, brothers, rejoice, be perfected, be comforted, think the same thing, be at peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Greet one another with a holy kiss.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> All the saints greet you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. <br><br>
