			<h4 id="job-1">Job 1</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and this man was perfect and upright, and he feared God and turned away from evil.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And his possessions were seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels and five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred female donkeys and a great many servants; and this man was greater than all the sons of the east.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And his sons would go and hold feasts in each one’s house, each on his own day, and they would send <i>word</i> and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And when the days of feasting ran their course, Job would send <i>word</i> and sanctify them; and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, Perhaps my children have sinned and have cursed God in their heart. Job did this continually.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Then one day, when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, Satan also came among them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Where have you come from? And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From roving the earth and going about in it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Have you considered My servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then Satan answered Jehovah and said, Does Job fear God without cause?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Have You not set a hedge around him and his household and all that he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his possessions are spread throughout the land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> But stretch forth Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Here is all that he has, in your hand; only do not stretch forth your hand against him. And Satan went forth from Jehovah’s presence.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then one day, when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> A messenger came to Job and said, The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys were feeding beside them;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the Sabeans fell <i>upon them</i> and took them away, and they struck the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to relate <i>these things</i> to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> While this one was still speaking, another came and said, The fire of God has fallen from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and devoured them; and I alone have escaped to relate <i>these things</i> to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> While this one was still speaking, another came and said, The Chaldeans formed three companies and raided the camels and took them, and they struck the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to relate <i>these things</i> to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> While this one was still speaking, another came and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And suddenly a great wind came from beyond the desert and struck the four corners of the house, so that it fell upon the young people and they died; and I alone have escaped to relate <i>these things</i> to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Then Job rose up and tore his clothes and shaved his head and fell to the earth and worshipped.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And he said, / Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, / And naked I will return there. / Jehovah gives and Jehovah takes away; / Blessed be the name of Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> In all this Job did not sin, nor did he charge God with unseemliness.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then one day, when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, Satan also came among them to present himself before Jehovah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Where have you come from? And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From roving the earth and going about in it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Have you considered My servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil. And he still holds fast his integrity, though you have moved Me against him to destroy him without cause.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Then Satan answered Jehovah and said, Skin for skin! Indeed all that a man has he will give for the sake of his life.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> But stretch forth Your hand, and touch his bone and his flesh; and he will surely curse You to Your face.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Satan, Here he is, in your hand; only spare his life.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Satan went forth from Jehovah’s presence and struck Job with severe boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And he took a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and he sat among the ashes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Should we receive the good from God but not receive the ill? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this misfortune that came upon him, each came from his place, Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite; and they together made an appointment to come to console him and comfort him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And when they lifted up their eyes from a distance and did not recognize him, they lifted up their voice and wept; and they all tore their clothes and cast dust over their heads toward heaven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights; but none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.<br><br>

			<h4 id="job-3">Job 3</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his <i>birth.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Job responded and said,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Let the day on which I was born perish, / And the night which said, A man has been conceived.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Let that day be darkness; / Let God not seek it from above, / Nor let light shine upon it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Let darkness and the shadow of death reclaim it; / Let a cloud dwell upon it; / Let the things that blacken the day terrify it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> As for that night, let deep darkness take hold of it; / Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; / Let it not come up in the number of the months.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Behold, let that night be barren; / Let no joyous shout come in it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Let those curse it who curse the day, / Who are ready to rouse leviathan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Let its predawn stars be dark; / Let it wait for light and there be none, / And do not let it see the eyelids of the dawn.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> For it did not shut up the doors of the womb <i>that bore</i> me, / Nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Why did I not die at birth, / Come forth from the womb and expire?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Why did the knees receive me? / And why the breasts, that I should suck?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> For now I would have lain down and been undisturbed; / I would have slept; then I would have been at rest<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> With kings and counselors of the earth, / Who rebuilt ruins for themselves;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Or with princes who had gold, / Who filled their houses with silver.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Or like a miscarriage that has been concealed, I would not have been, / Like infants that do not see the light.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> There the wicked cease from <i>their</i> troubling, / And there the weary rest.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Captives are altogether at ease; / They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> The small and the great are there, / And the servant is free from his master.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Why does He give light to him who suffers / And life to the bitter in soul,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Who wait for death, but it is not there; / And dig for it more than for hidden treasures;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Who rejoice to the point of exultation / And are glad when they have found the grave;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> To the man whose way is hidden / And whom God has hedged in?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> For my sighing comes as my food, / And my groaning pours out like water.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> For I dread something, and it comes upon me; / And what I fear comes to me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> I have no ease and I have no quiet / And I have no rest, but trouble comes.<br><br>

			<h4 id="job-4">Job 4</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> If one attempts a word with you, will you be wearied <i>by it?</i> / But who can refrain from speaking?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Indeed, you have instructed many, / And you have strengthened the weak hands.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Your words have raised up him who was stumbling, / And you have made the bowing knees firm.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> But now it comes to you, and you are wearied <i>by it;</i> / It touches you, and you are disturbed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Is not your fear <i>of God</i> your confidence, / And the integrity of your ways your hope?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Remember now, who, being innocent, has <i>ever</i> perished? / And where have the upright <i>ever</i> been cut off?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity / And those who sow trouble reap the same.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> By the breath of God they perish, / And by the blast of His anger they are consumed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> The roaring of the lion and the sound of the fierce lion / And the teeth of the young lions are broken;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, / And the whelps of the lioness are scattered.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> But a matter has stolen in unto me, / And my ear has received a whisper of it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> In perplexing thoughts of the night visions, / When deep sleep falls upon men,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Dread came upon me, and trembling, / And caused all my bones to dread.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And a spirit passed before my face; / The hair of my flesh bristled.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; / A form <i>stood</i> before my eyes; / I heard a murmur of a voice:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Can a mortal man be more righteous than God? / Can a man be purer than his Maker?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> If He puts no trust in His servants, / And He charges His angels with error,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, / Whose foundation is in dust, / Who are crushed like a moth!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> From morning to evening they are smashed to pieces; / Without any considering <i>it,</i> they continually perish.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Should their tent cord be plucked up within them, / They die, and not in wisdom.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Call now! Is there anyone who will answer you? / And to which of the holy ones will you turn?<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> I have seen the fool taking root, / But suddenly I cursed his habitation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> His children are far from safety, / And they are crushed in the gate; and there is no one to deliver <i>them.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> The hungry eat his harvest / And even take <i>it</i> out from the thorns, / And the thirsty pant after his wealth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> For evil does not come forth from the dust, / Nor does trouble spring forth from the ground.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> But man is born unto trouble, / Just as sparks fly upward.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> But as for me, I would seek after God, / And I would commit my cause to God,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Who does great things that cannot be searched, / Wonderful deeds that cannot be numbered;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Who gives rain upon the surface of the earth / And sends water upon the surface of the fields;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Who sets on high those who are lowly / And puts those who mourn safely above <i>all.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> He frustrates the devices of the crafty, / So that their hands achieve no enterprise.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> He seizes the wise in their own craftiness, / And the counsel of the wily is brought to a sudden end.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> By day they encounter darkness, / And at noon they grope about as in the night.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> But He saves the needy from the sword of their mouth, / From the hand of the strong.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Thus the poor have hope, / And Injustice stops her mouth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Indeed, blessed is the man whom God corrects; / Therefore do not reject the chastening of the Almighty.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> For He wounds, but He binds up; / He strikes, but His hands heal.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> In six troubles He will deliver you; / Indeed in seven no evil will touch you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> In famine He will redeem you from death, / And in battle, from the power of the sword.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> From the scourge of the tongue you will be hidden, / And you will not be afraid of destruction when it comes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> At destruction and at famine you will laugh, / And you will not be afraid of the animals of the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> For you will be in an alliance with the stones of the field, / And the animals of the field will be at peace with you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And you will know that your tent is at peace, / And you will inspect your fold and miss nothing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And you will know that your seed will be great, / And your offspring like the grass of the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> You will come to the grave at a ripe old age, / Like a shock of grain coming up in its season.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Job answered and said,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Oh that my vexation were weighed indeed, / And that my ruin were lifted onto the scales together with <i>it!</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; / Therefore my words have been rash.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> For the arrows of the Almighty are in me, / The poison of which my spirit drinks up; / The terrors of God are arrayed against me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Does the wild ass bray over <i>its</i> grass? / Or does the ox low over its fodder?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Is what is savorless eaten without salt? / Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> My soul refuses to touch <i>them;</i> / They are like putrid food to me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Oh that I might have my request, / And that God would grant <i>me</i> what I long for;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> That God would be willing to crush me; / That He would release His hand and cut me off!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Then there would still be comfort for me; / And I would exult, <i>even</i> in writhing pain that does not spare, / That I did not deny the words of the Holy One.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> What is my strength, that I should wait? / And what is my end, that I should be patient?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Is my strength the strength of stones? / Or is my flesh bronze?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Is there any help for me at all within me, / And has wisdom been driven away from me?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> To him who is fainting <i>there should be</i> kindness from his friend, / Else he will forsake the fear of the Almighty.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> My brothers have dealt as treacherously as a desert brook, / As the rivulets of the desert brooks that pass away,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Which are turbid because of the ice, / <i>And</i> into which the snow hides itself.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> When they are scorched, they are completely consumed; / When it is hot, they are dried up from their place.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Caravans divert their ways <i>for them;</i> / They go up into the waste and perish.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> The caravans of Tema look <i>for them;</i> / The companies of Sheba long for them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> They are put to shame because they are confident; / They go there and are confounded.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> So now you have become such; / You see a terrible thing and are afraid.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Have I said, Give me <i>something?</i> / Or, Pay a bribe for me out of your wealth?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Or, Deliver me from the hand of the adversary? / Or, From the hand of the oppressors redeem me?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Teach me, and I will be silent; / Cause me to understand how I have erred.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> How forceful are upright words! / But what does <i>this</i> reproving from you reprove?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Do you think you can reprove words? / But the words of a desperate man are for the wind.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> You would even cast <i>lots</i> over the orphan / And bargain over your friend.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Now then be pleased to look upon me, / For surely I will not lie to your face.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Turn now; let there be no injustice. / Indeed turn; my righteousness is still here.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> If I say, I will forget my complaint, / I will put off my <i>sad</i> countenance and look cheerful;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> I fear all my pains: / I know that You will not hold me innocent.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> You who tear yourself in your anger, / Will the earth be forsaken for your sake, / Or will the rock be removed from its place?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Indeed the light of the wicked goes out, / And the flame of his fire does not shine.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> A snare grabs <i>him</i> by the heel; / A trap lays hold on him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> A rope is hidden for him on the ground, / And a trap for him, on the path.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> His strength is famished, / And calamity is prepared at his side.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> He is rooted out of his tent, in which he trusts; / And he is made to march to the king of terrors.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> That which is not his dwells in his tent; / Brimstone is scattered upon his habitation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Beneath, his roots are dried up; / And above, his branch is withered.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> The memory of him perishes from the earth, / And he has no name on the open plain.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> He is thrust out from the light to the darkness / And driven from the world.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> He has no posterity and no progeny among his people, / And there are none remaining where he sojourned.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Those who come after will be astonished at his day, / As those who went before were horrified.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Surely these are the dwellings of the unjust, / And this is the place of him who does not know God.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> This is the portion with God for a wicked man, / And the inheritance that oppressors receive from the Almighty:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword; / And his offspring will not be satisfied with bread;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Those who remain of him will be buried in death, / And his widows will not lament.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Though he heaps up silver like dust / And prepares garments like clay,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> He may prepare <i>them,</i> but the righteous will wear <i>them;</i> / And the innocent will divide the silver.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> He builds his house as a moth does / And like a hut that a watchman makes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> He lies down rich but <i>will be rich</i> no more; / He opens his eyes, and he is not.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Terrors overtake him like waters; / At night a whirlwind steals him away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> The east wind carries him off, and he goes; / And it sweeps him out of his place.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And <i>God</i> hurls at him and does not spare; / He hastily flees from His hand.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> The miner sends forth his hand into the flinty rock; / He overturns the mountains by <i>its</i> roots.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> He cuts out channels in the rocks, / And his eye sees every precious thing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle, / And that which is hidden he brings out to the light.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> But where shall wisdom be found? / And where is the place of understanding?<br><br>

				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Rare gold cannot be given for it, / Nor can silver be weighed out for its price.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> It cannot be balanced with the gold of Ophir, / With precious onyx or <i>with</i> sapphire.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> From where then does wisdom come? / And where is the place of understanding?<br><br>

				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> After my words they spoke not again, / And my speech distilled <i>like</i> <i>dew</i> upon them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And they waited for me as for the rain, / And they opened their mouth wide <i>as</i> for the late rain.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> I smiled on them — they could not believe <i>it;</i> / And they did not cast down the light of my countenance.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> His flesh is so consumed that it cannot be seen, / And his bones that had not been seen stick out.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And his soul draws near to the pit, / And his life, to the destroyers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> If there is with him an angel, / An interpreter, one of a thousand, / To declare to man what is right for him,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Then He will be gracious to him and will say, / Redeem him from going down into the pit; / I have found a ransom.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> His flesh will be fresher than in childhood; / He will return to the days of his youth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> He will pray to God, and He will accept him, / So that he sees His face with joyous shouting; / And God restores to man his righteousness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> He will sing to men and say, / I sinned and perverted what was right, / But it was not paid back to me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> He has redeemed my soul from perishing in the pit, / And my life will see the light.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Indeed, all these things God accomplishes for a man, / Twice, even three times,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> To bring his soul back from the pit, / To enlighten <i>him</i> with the light of the living.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Take heed, Job; hear me. / Be silent, and I will speak.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> There is no darkness and no shadow of death / Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> For He does not <i>need</i> to consider a man further, / That he should go to God in litigation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> He breaks mighty men in pieces without inquiry / And puts others in their stead.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Because they turned aside from following after Him / And would not regard any of His ways,<br><br>

				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Your wickedness <i>affects</i> a man like you, / And your righteousness, a son of man.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Now therefore take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer them as a burnt offering for yourselves. And My servant Job will pray for you; for I will accept him, so that I do not deal with you <i>according to your</i> folly; for you have not spoken concerning Me that which is right, as My servant Job has.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as Jehovah told them; and Jehovah accepted Job.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends, and Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And all his brothers and all his sisters and all his previous acquaintances came to him and ate bread with him in his house. And they consoled and comforted him for all the misfortune that Jehovah had brought upon him. And each gave to him a piece of money, and each, a gold ring.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Thus Jehovah blessed Job’s latter end more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep and six thousand camels and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand female donkeys.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And he had seven sons and three daughters.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And he named the first Jemimah, and the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And in all the land no women were found as beautiful as the daughters of Job. And their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And after this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; and he saw his children and his grandchildren, <i>even</i> four generations.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Job died, old and full of days.<br><br>
